-- Proof of integrity --
* ensure message wasn't altered in transit
* use hashing

-- Proof of origin --
* verify who sent the message and that it wasn't forged
* use digital signatures

-- Creating and verifying a digital signature --
1) alice sends a message to bob
2) alice hashes the message
3) alice private key encrypts the hash (creating a digital signature)
4) bob recieves the message and the digital signature
5) bob uses alice's public key to decrypt digital signature to reveal the alice's hash
6) bob hashes the message and compares with the decrypted hash
