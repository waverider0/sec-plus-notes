-- AAA framework --
* identification: username
* authentication: password
* authorization: determine permissions
* accounting: logging

-- VPN example --
1) client wants to connect to an internal file server
2) client sends auth details to VPN concentrator
3) VPN reaches out to AAA server to validate credentials
4) AAA server authorizes credentials
5) VPN grants access to internal file server

-- Authenticating systems --
* can't type a password so instead we put a digitally signed certificate on the device

-- Certificate authentication --
* an organization has a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
* most orgs maintain their own CAs
1) CA digitally signs the device cert
2) when device trys to access confidential info, the cert is verified by the CA (proof of origin)

-- Authorization model --
* basically like discord roles
* each group has a set of associated permissions
