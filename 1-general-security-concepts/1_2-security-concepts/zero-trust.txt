once inside the firewall, lateral movement is often unchecked

-- Zero trust premise --
* nothing is inherently trusted
* all access requrests must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted
* applies to everything (users, devices, processes, etc.)

-- "Planes of operation" --
* data plane (actual traffic): packets, NAT, routing
* control plane (config and logic): policies, routing tables, firewall rules

-- Adaptive identity --
* determine trust level of the person making the request
* consider factors like: geolocation, user role, IP origin, user role, connection type
* make authentication strong if needed (multiple captchas, 2FA)

-- Access restrictions --
* limit access points to reduce attack surface
* e.g: on-prem only, VPN required

-- Zero trust flow --
user makes a request -> ) PEP (policy enforcement point) grants or denies access
(PEP is just a piece of software like a firewall)

But the test wants you to memorize all of this random jargon!
1. PEP intercepts requests and forwards to "policy admin"
2. admin consults PDP (policy decision point)
3. PDP consults polices, makes decision
4. admin relays outcome to PEP
5. PEP grants or denies access
